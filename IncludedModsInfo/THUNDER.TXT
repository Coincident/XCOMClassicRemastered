#Alternate Lightning - Thunder Mod by hellrazor
#Version without Lightning Front Door.

The THUNDER is a complete replacement for the rarely used LIGHTNING.
It has the same stats as it, with the exception of a Troop capacity of up to
18 Soldiers, it is also capable of bringing Tanks into combat.

Possible Loadouts:

- 18 Soldiers or

- 14 Soldiers + 1 Tank or

- 10 Soldiers + 2 Tanks.

Added:
- THUNDER.MCD
- THUNDER.PCK
- THUNDER.TAB

Which are renamed and patched Version of Lightning MCD file, so no one can complain about shitty Maps anymore :>

Fixed: Soldier Position in the Deployment
