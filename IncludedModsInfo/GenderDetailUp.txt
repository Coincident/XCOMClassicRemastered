Gender Detail Up Mod
====================

# SUMMARY
It makes female charactors more feminine

# MOD INFORMATION

Yes, all female combatants of X-COM are as tough as male combatants. There is no difference between men and women in X-COM world, except there looks.

And that is the point. Why female charactors of X-COM are so MANLY as men? Is it necessary to be so bulky to become tough equal to men?
I don't think so.

This mode changes looks of famale charactors in none or personal armor to be more feminine. I can't change power or flying armor. It seems that looks of the armors doesn't vary as wearer's gender or race.
